-- The example states that a group of order 20 cannot be simple
example (hG : Fintype.card G = 20) : ¬ IsSimpleGroup G := by
  -- Establish that 5 is a prime number
  have h₀ : Nat.Prime 5 := by norm_num

  -- Prove that 5 divides the order of the group G
  have h₂ : 5 ∣ Fintype.card G := by use 4 -- 5 divides 20 (20 = 4 * 5)

  -- Apply Sylow's theorem to conclude the existence of a Sylow 5-subgroup
  -- The theorem guarantees a subgroup of order 5^1, as 5 is a prime dividing the group's order

  -- We extract the actual subgroup Q which satisfies the Sylow p-subgroup conditions for p=5

  have h₈ : Fintype.card (Sylow 5 G) = 1 := by sorry

  -- Conclude the existence and uniqueness of the Sylow 5-subgroup, implying it is normal
  -- The uniqueness of the Sylow subgroup follows from h₈ and the properties of Sylow subgroups

  -- Prove that the unique Sylow subgroup P is a normal subgroup of G
  -- This will use the fact that a unique Sylow subgroup is always normal

  -- Conclude that G is not simple because it has a normal subgroup of order 5
  -- This final step uses the definition of a simple group, which cannot have non-trivial normal subgroups
