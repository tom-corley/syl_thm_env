Wanted to explain a few things to you guys for using Git.

We will be working on a Git repository (which is really just a glorified online folder), hosted online on Github. (it's @ https://github.com/tom-corley/syl_thm_env).

Gitpod is essentially just VSCode on the browser, but it is also integrated with Git in a nice way which allows us to work directly in this repository. However there are problems in getting lean to work on this format, which I'm currently trying to fix. 

The hard part is managing four people simultaneously updating and adding things to this repository.

The way this works, is by using branches. When anyone works locally, or on gitpod, on files in the repository, they are actually working on a parallel branch of it. To actually save ("commit") their changes to the repository itself, they need to "push" their code onto the main (master) branch.

Essentially, what you guys need to know are the basic commands to download from, and upload to the repository, use the last three successively to update the repository with your changes.

git status: this tell you whether your local branch is behind (you need to pull) or ahead (you need to push) of the master branch
 
git pull : this pulls in any changes made to the repository onto your local branch

git add : this prepares ("stages") any changes you have made to be committed to your local branch, to add all changes (you'll want to use this 90% of the time) use "git add ."

git commit -m "<your_message_here>" : this commits the changes you make, to your local branch. You should always try to include a commit message, because this lets everyone else know what your changes were

git push : this pushes the changes you have committed to your local branch onto the master branch, Updating the repository itself, and allowing other people to pull them in.
